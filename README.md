# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

Built a dash app that displays a stock portfolios value over time.  Interactive, so you can toggle which stocks are being displayed at a time.

To run just call `python plotter.py` and open `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`

## Who Did What?

* Raymond: Worked on pulling stock data from alphavantage.  Added dash to display the plotly component.

* Eddie: Used plotly to display stock portfolio value over time.

## What you learned

Learned how to use plotly to display interactive graphs.  Relates to potential project of displaying salary info as well as projected bonus growth or other statistics.

Learned how to use Dash to deploy a web server that can display these plotly graphs.  Would be useful and avoids having to use Flask.

### Things that didn't work:

First attempted to use Flask, but it was a bit annoying to use, so we transitioned to dash since it worked a lot smoother.  Need to display plotly graphs in a way that's easy to understand the data.
